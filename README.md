<h2>About the pidAdmin application</h2>
<p align="justify">
A persistent identifier (PID) is a long-lasting reference to a digital objectâ€”a single file or set of files. With this approach, references to the data are decoupled from its physical location, thus allowing a high degree of flexibility while ensuring that the information will always be accessible.  Catania Science Gateway is committed to this approach, allowing the usage of PIDs to specify the location of the input files of many of the integrated applications. Of course, the user can also employ it to identify the place where the output of a given execution has been stored.  pidAdmin is a very simple application devoted to manage these PIDs. It allows to create or delete PIDs corresponding to the different existing applications, greatly simplifying their management and making it accesible to any user of Catania Science Gateway.
